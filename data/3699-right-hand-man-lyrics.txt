For just a millisecond
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second
Now Im the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up to put me up on a pedestal
Writin letters to relatives
Embellishin my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go¦

Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people Im

We gotta run to Harlem quick we cant afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces theyre skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny
Are these the men with which I am to defend America
We ride at midnight Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once people
Im in dire need of assistance¦

[BURR]
Your excellency sir

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you

[BURR]
Aaron Burr Sir
Permission to state my case

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]

on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
